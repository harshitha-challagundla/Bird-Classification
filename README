Enhancing bird species classification is a significant step in biodiversity research, ecological studies, and conservation efforts. This project introduces a comprehensive approach using a custom-modified EfficientNet-B0 model, integrated with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks to enhance feature sensitivity. The model leverages advanced deep learning techniques, including transfer learning, data augmentation, and dynamic learning rate scheduling, achieving a remarkable 99.40% test accuracy. Additionally, the project features PaliGemma, a hybrid AI model combining SigLIP (a vision model) and Gemma (a language model), capable of generating descriptive narratives of bird species from image inputs. Together, these methodologies enable detailed and accurate identification, providing valuable insights into bird populations and ecosystems.

The dataset used comprises over 225 bird species, processed with normalization and augmented with techniques such as cropping, flipping, and color distortion to enhance model generalization. The custom EfficientNet-B0 model incorporates dropout layers and dense output layers for robust multi-class classification. Training was conducted using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a cross-entropy loss function, and the model’s performance was rigorously evaluated through metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and loss curves. Meanwhile, PaliGemma complements this classification by integrating vision and language processing to deliver detailed, context-rich textual descriptions, making it an excellent tool for research and education.

This work not only advances fine-grained bird classification but also paves the way for real-time applications, such as mobile bird identification systems and conservation tools. Expanding the dataset to include birds from diverse geographic and seasonal conditions is a proposed future direction to improve the model’s applicability. Overall, this project highlights the potential of combining innovative deep learning architectures and hybrid AI models for addressing complex ecological challenges.
